## Set Up

### Github pages 
Based on github pages using one of the pre-set themes for API documents called: [Just the Docs].

### Docker

Had a couple of failed attempts installing the right Ruby version and dependencies. Ended up created an image on docker with the following specs: 

- Ubuntu 22.04
- Ruby 3.1.2
- Jekyll 3.9.3

Huge thanks to Bill Raymond and his Ubuntu Docker Container walkthrough available <a href="https://youtu.be/zijOXpZzdvs?si=7wU536lC2XoEiX26">here.</a></strong></p>

## Etiquette 

### Conventional Commits 

I followed [Conventional Commits] specification for my commit messages visible in my [public repo]

### Design and development principles of this theme:

1. As few dependencies as possible
2. No build script needed
3. First class mobile experience
4. Make the content shine

### Scratchpad
```bundle install```
<br>

```bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload```

<br>
<br>
