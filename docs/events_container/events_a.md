# Product Camp - May 2024

## Workshop: "What if we let GenAI do the work of a PM?" 
We gathered a group of PMs and tasked them to only use GenAI to come up with Vision, Strategy, OKR and Roadmap for a product... 

## Insights
- Critical thinking seems irreplaceable 
- "Show me the reasoning" was a group favourite 
- Providing examples of "wrong" examples helps fine tune answers
- OKRs follow SMART goal framework
- Wall-of-text-format, makes it hard to see connections and sequence of thought
