of the Convinced Google Flights & meta searchers to update referral booking experience; +200% in meta bookings

<strong> The discovery</strong> - Creating a new page after flight selection, allowed us to deeplink referral trafic further into the funnel and even created an opportunity to upsell to higher fares.

<strong>The problem</strong> - Launch and grow the airline's first self-serve ticket exchange portal and maintain a positive CSAT score. 

<strong> The discovery</strong> - Word of mouth was the main driver for growth. Prioritizing features that fixed errors experienced by our frequent traveler cohort, created a positive CSAT score and word of mouth recommendations.

### Project 3: Flight Combination Algorithm
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

<strong>The problem</strong> - Round trip flight itineraries were not always combinable, creating website errors and ultimately a bad user experience.

<strong> The discovery</strong> - After 2 failed attempts, I convinced members from pricing and inventory planning teams to help me test and de-bug.

<strong> The result</strong> - We identified and solved 5 scenarios, ultimately reducing website error rate from 8% to 5.6%.
