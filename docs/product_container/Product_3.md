### Project 1: Standardizing Process
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

<strong>The problem</strong> - App development was crafted around personalized voice applications. This new use case required PolyAI to deliver faster and thus branching out a different development process.

<strong> The discovery</strong> - Through analyzing the call and intent data of 7 live versions of the voice application, I was able to identify 24 FAQs out of 150, that addressed 90% of the call volume.

<strong> The result</strong> - This insight enabled us to refactor bottlenecks in our development process reducing time-to-go-live from 3 weeks to 3 days.

### Project 2: Defining key operational metrics
<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

<strong>The problem</strong> - PolyAI had 7 different live versions for the same use case, and had 200 customers in the implementation pipeline. The scope of work was - how do we define what quality is? and quantify it going forward.

<strong> The discovery</strong> - I evaluated the performance of the distinct versions according to the typical 3 key metrics of call cneters: effectivity, efficiency and customer satisfaction. Then, compared the versions amongst each other to establish a baseline value and confidence intervals.

<strong> The result</strong> -  The dashboard highlighted voice agents behaving out of the norm, enabling the partnerships team to intervene when needed. Six months later the programme accumulated 1.1 million customer calls with 84% serviced without a human and 80% positive customer ratings.
