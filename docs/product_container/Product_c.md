<strong>The problem</strong> - Referral trafic from Google Flights and Kayak wanting to book a flight,landed at the first stage of the booking funnel, resulting in a 2% conversion rate.

of the Convinced Google Flights & meta searchers to update referral booking experience; +200% in meta bookings

<strong> The discovery</strong> - Creating a new page after flight selection, allowed us to deeplink referral trafic further into the funnel and even created an opportunity to upsell to higher fares.

### Project 3: Flight Combination Algorithm

<strong>The problem</strong> - Round trip flight itineraries were not always combinable, creating website errors and ultimately a bad user experience.

<strong> The discovery</strong> - After 2 failed attempts, I convinced members from pricing and inventory planning teams to help me test and de-bug.

<strong> The result</strong> - We identified and solved 5 scenarios, ultimately reducing website error rate from 8% to 5.6%.
