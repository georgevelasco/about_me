# Product Camp May 2024

Workshop: "What if we let GenAI do the work of a PM?" 

We brought together a group of PMs and challenged them to use only GenAI to develop the Vision, Strategy, OKRs, and Roadmap for a product.

Some of the insights:
- Critical thinking seems irreplaceable 
- "Show me the reasoning" was a group favourite 
- Providing examples of "wrong" examples helps fine tune answers
- OKRs follow SMART goal framework
- Wall-of-text-format, makes it hard to see connections and sequence of thought
