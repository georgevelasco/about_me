# Jorge Velasco
[/in/georgevelasco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgevelasco/)

Product Manager with 7 years of experience ranging from early stage start-ups in London to multi-national corporates in Mexico City. Cambridge MBA graduate and Industrial and Systems Engineer.

### I enjoy at breaking down problems into smaller parts
Once I can draw it in a napkin and explain it, I know I have figured it out.

### I treasure the mental tussle of co-creation
Understanding the different perspectives to a situation, and explaining my own in other terms.

### I excel at written communication but are a visual learner 
I mentor up-and-coming product managers and proofread graduate school applications.
