<h1>Jorge Velasco </h1>

<h3> About Me </h3>

<p>I enjoy breaking down problems into smaller parts. It makes me feel accomplished when I understand a topic so well, that I can visually explain it in a napkin.</p>
<p></p>  
<p>I enjoy the mental tussle of co-creation. To learn about how people approach the same situations and figuring out an efficient way to explain my own view.</p> 
<p></p>  
<p>Fostering trust amongst diverse ways of thought, to allow the uninterrupted flow of thoughts </p>
