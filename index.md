# Jorge Velasco

### I enjoy breaking down problems into smaller parts
Once I can draw it in a napkin and explain it, I know I have figured it out.

### I enjoy the mental tussle of co-creation
Understanding the different perspectives to a situation, and explaining my own in other terms.

### I am learning to give concise, actionable feedback
I proofread graduate school applications and mentor up-and-coming product managers.

### I am learning to be a better person
Outside of work, I am writing poetry in spanish and mastering joint mobility exercises.
