# Jorge Velasco
[/in/georgevelasco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgevelasco/)

Cambridge MBA with 7 years of experience in Product Management, ranging from tech start-ups in London to multi-national enterprises in Mexico.

### I enjoy breaking down problems into smaller parts
Once I can draw it in a napkin and explain it, I know I have figured it out.

### I enjoy the mental tussle of co-creation
Understanding the different perspectives to a situation, and explaining my own in other terms.

### I am learning to give concise, actionable feedback
I proofread graduate school applications and mentor up-and-coming product managers.
