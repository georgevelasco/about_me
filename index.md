### I enjoy breaking down problems into smaller parts
Once I can draw it in a napkin and explain it, I know I have it figured out.

### I treasure the mental tussle of co-creation
I focus on framing problems with clear boundaries and assumptions made, embracing the different perspectives of the team towards solving a problem.

### I excel at written communication but are a visual learner 
I strongly believe transparency and short-written communication makes succesful teams however I think in squares and lines.
