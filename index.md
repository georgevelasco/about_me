### About Me 

I enjoy breaking down problems into smaller parts. One I can visually explain the concept in a napkin, I know I have figured it out.

I enjoy the mental tussle of co-creation. To learn the distinct perspectives to a situation, and the challenge to figure out an efficient way to explain my own view.
