<h3> About Me </h3>

<p>I enjoy breaking down problems into smaller parts. One I can visually explain the concept in a napkin, I know I have figured it out. </p>
<p></p>  
<p>I enjoy the mental tussle of co-creation. To learn the distinct persepctives to a situation, and the challenge to figure out an efficient way to explain my own view.</p>
